# EAZYCTRL

Python module and command line tool to monitor and control the air exchangers of
Helios (KWL EasyControls) via their Modbus/TCP interface. It should allow for an
easy integration of the air exchanger into smart home systems (e.g. via Home
Assistant).

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: The routines and the command line tool are not provided and
have been not approved by the Helios GmbH. They were created based on the
publicly available documents about the EasyControls Modbus/TCP interface and
about the Modbus/TCP protocol. They were only tested with a Helios KWL EC 300 W
air exchanger. **Use them on your own risk**.
